# Imperative Programming Project – Nutrition Management System

This project, developed in **C**, aims to apply concepts of **imperative programming** to build a system that manages and monitors patients’ nutritional data in a diet management context.

---

## Main Objectives

- Reinforce **problem analysis** and **structured programming** techniques.  
- Apply **imperative programming** principles in **C**.  
- Handle data through **file input/output**, **modular design**, and **data processing**.

---

## Features

1. **Load Data from Files**  
   - Patient information (ID, name, phone)  
   - Dietary records (patient ID, date, meal, food, calories)  
   - Nutritional plans (min/max allowed calories per meal)

2. **Statistical and Analytical Operations**  
   - Count patients exceeding a calorie threshold in a given period  
   - List patients with meals outside their nutritional limits  
   - Display a patient’s nutrition plan for a specific meal and period  
   - Calculate average calorie intake per meal and patient  
   - Generate a **summary table** comparing planned vs. consumed calories
